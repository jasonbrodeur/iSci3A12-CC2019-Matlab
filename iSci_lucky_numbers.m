%% lucky_numbers.m
%%% This function uses the input of the user's name (in string format), and
%%% returns their lucky numbers (between 1 and 49) for the day --  Numbers are not guaranteed,
%%% but if one should win with these numbers, the program creator requests
%%% at least 20%
%%% usage: lucky_nums = iSci_lucky_numbers('Bobby') - where 'bobby' is any name
%%%                                             in string format

% Check to see if the person's name is less than 6 characters long.  
% If so, we have to make up random numbers to get up to 6:

    %%% previous run (make sure it's unique).
    same =  find(lucky_nums(1,1:6) == temp_num, 1);
    %%% If we have, then we'll go through again and try and get a new one.
